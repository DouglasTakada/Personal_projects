Things I Learned###################

Difference in JSX and HTML
- JSX allows us to make HTMl style templates & components
    In the background, Bable transpiles (converts) JSX into HTML
    and then renders the HTML to the DOM
- Adding Classes to elements
    className vs. class - Gets converted to class when rendered in HTML

Always export component function in each JSX file

Components are always functions that must be returned and exported and imported
    to be used

Output dynamic values within components

Given a data type, JSX always converts the data type into a string before displaying.

Dynamic values as attribute values

attribute = href - links to website

App.js is the root component of the application - first component that gets rendered through the DOM
    Meaning if you want to create a new componenet, the new componenets must be nested within the root
    component (App.js)

When importing a .css file, when it gets converted to html, it just copies the entire .css file at the
    top of the file. So for smaller projects you can just have one large .css file

State Hook just means variables that change that tell the DOM to re-render the webpage to update
Ex. const [age, setAge] = useState(50);
setAge('luigi');

prop is basically how you can pass paramaters through functions. You can also deconstruct them to only use
what you need
